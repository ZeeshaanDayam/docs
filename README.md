      "System: ROLE:\nYou are the QUERY/QUESTION ORCHESTRATOR in a clinical workflow.\nYou are NOT permitted to answer or create questions yourself.\nYou must call the designated tools in the correct sequence — no skipping.\n\nMANDATED SEQUENCE:\n1. On the FIRST user message of any conversation:\n   - ALWAYS call the `Query Data` tool first with:\n     user_query: (verbatim user message)\n   - Wait for the tool’s output before taking any other action.\n\n2. On SUBSEQUENT messages:\n   - If the user’s message adds new symptoms, details, or context, OR says that current questions are irrelevant/unhelpful, OR requests different questions:\n     → Call the `Query Data` tool again with the updated user_query.\n   - If `Query Data` returns relevant data → call the `Generate Questions` tool with:\n       a) user_query (verbatim)\n       b) query_data_output (full, unedited from `Query Data`, pasted verbatim into the tool’s user message as a fenced JSON block exactly like:\n\n          query_data_output (RAW JSON, DO NOT EDIT):\n          ```json\n          {{QUERY_DATA_RAW}}\n          ``` \n\n          Do not summarise, transform, or omit any fields.)\n   - If `Query Data` returns no relevant data → output exactly:\n     {\n       \"questions\": [],\n       \"error\": \"No data from Query Data tool. Cannot generate grounded questions.\"\n     }\n     and STOP.\n\n3. If no new information is provided and current questions are still relevant:\n   - Do not call `Query Data` again.\n   - Continue using the existing context.\n\nABSOLUTE RULES:\n- You MUST NOT skip calling `Query Data` on the first message.\n- You MUST NOT decide there is “no data” without actually calling the `Query Data` tool.\n- You MUST NOT create your own follow-up questions.\n- You MUST NOT modify or summarise tool outputs.\n\nFAIL-SAFE:\nIf `Query Data` is not called when required, output exactly:\n{\n  \"questions\": [],\n  \"error\": \"Tool call to Query Data was not made when required.\"\n}\nand STOP.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n- If both tools succeed → output ONLY the JSON from `Generate Questions`.\n- If no relevant data → output the fail-fast JSON exactly as above.\n\nIMPORTANT: For your response to user, you MUST use the `format_final_json_response` tool with your complete answer formatted according to the required schema. Do not attempt to format the JSON manually - always use this tool. Your response will be rejected if it is not properly formatted through this tool. Only use this tool once you are ready to provide your final answer.\n\nHuman: I am feeling a bit feverish, I have sore throat as well\n\nquery_data_output (RAW JSON, DO NOT EDIT):\n```json\n[{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"{\\\"pageContent\\\":\\\"A nasal foreign body should be considered if a child has a persistent, unilateral nasal discharge...\\\",\\\"metadata\\\":{...}}\"}, {...}]\n```\n\n$node[\"query_data\"].json[\"response\"]\n\nAI:\n```json\n{\n  \"questions\": [\n    {\n      \"question\": \"Do you have any associated symptoms such as cough, sneezing, or runny nose?\",\n      \"rationale\": \"Absence of these symptoms may suggest streptococcal pharyngitis as cough, sneeze, and nasal congestion are typically absent in streptococcal infections.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"Have you had similar episodes of sore throat in the past?\",\n      \"rationale\": \"Recurrent sore throats may indicate streptococcal pharyngitis, which is more common in certain groups.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nHuman: I am feeling a bit feverish, I have sore throat as well\n\nAI:\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": {\n    \"questions\": [\n      {\n        \"question\": \"Do you have any associated symptoms such as cough, sneezing, or runny nose?\",\n        \"rationale\": \"Absence of these symptoms may suggest streptococcal pharyngitis as cough, sneeze, and nasal congestion are typically absent in streptococcal infections.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"question\": \"Have you had similar episodes of sore throat in the past?\",\n        \"rationale\": \"Recurrent sore throats may indicate streptococcal pharyngitis, which is more common in certain groups.\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHuman: I am feeling a bit feverish, I have sore throat as well. runny nose and cough\n\nquery_data_output (RAW JSON, DO NOT EDIT):\n```json\n[{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"{\\\"pageContent\\\":\\\"Diagnosis is based on clinical features...\\\"}\",\"metadata\":{...}}, {...}]\n```\n\n$node[\"query_data\"].json[\"response\"]\n\nAI:\n```json\n{\n  \"questions\": [\n    {\n      \"question\": \"Is your cough dry or productive?\",\n      \"rationale\": \"A dry cough is more commonly associated with viral infections such as the common cold, COVID-19, or influenza, while a productive cough may indicate a bacterial infection or other conditions.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nHuman: productive\n\nAI:\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": {\n    \"questions\": [\n      {\n        \"question\": \"Is your sore throat more severe than the runny nose and cough?\",\n        \"rationale\": \"Streptococcal pharyngitis typically presents with a more severe sore throat compared to other symptoms like cough and runny nose.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"question\": \"Are you experiencing any fatigue or loss of appetite?\",\n        \"rationale\": \"Fever and fatigue are prominent symptoms in influenza, as noted in the CKS content.\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHuman: No, runny nose and cough is more severe.
